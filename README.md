This project is designed to teach the **fundamentals of caching** in .NET applications. It covers both **in-memory caching** and **distributed caching** using Redis, along with practical implementation examples.

## ðŸ“š Key Learning Outcomes  
1. **In-Memory and Distributed Caching Basics**  
   - Learn how caching works in-memory and in distributed systems.  
   - Understand the differences between the two approaches and their use cases.  

2. **Redis Fundamentals**  
   - Explore how to set and retrieve various data types in Redis.  
   - Learn to establish and manage connections to a Redis server.  

3. **Building a Caching Structure**  
   - Implement a caching mechanism in an API using the **Decorator Design Pattern**.  

The project is divided into multiple branches, please check for the topics given above.
